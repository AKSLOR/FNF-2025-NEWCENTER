# REASSURING INFORMATION! (I GUESS)

- NEWCENTER SUPPORTS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY?

# NO, NEWCENTER IS NOT BASED ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT! IT'S A 1000% STRAIGHT COMPAGNY IF YOU PREFER!

# CAN ANY CHARACTER BE IN IT?

- YES! ANY CHARACTER CAN BE IN NEWCENTER. IT CAN BE SONIC, MARIO, GOKU, AND OTHER CHARACTERS FROM OTHER COMPANIES AND FRANCHISEES! (OBVIOUSLY, YOU NEED SPRITES OR A COMPATIBLE MOD OR A SPRITE THAT WORKS PERFECTLY!)

# WHAT IS NEWCENTER INSPIRED BY? 

- NEWCENTER IS INSPIRED BY NEWGROUNDS, A SITE WHERE YOU CAN PUBLISH GAMES, ARTS, ETC.... AND NEWCENTER, WELL, IT'S LIKE ITS COUSIN, BUT IT'S JUST A SIMPLE DISCORD SERVER!

# IS NEWCENTER JUST AN FNF MOD?

- NOT ONLY CAN IT BE MULTIPLE GAME MODS FROM DIFFERENT FRANCHISES, BUT WE HAVE NO OTHER GAMES BESIDES THE FNF ONE FOR NOW! BUT NEWCENTER IS ALSO MORE THAN A SIMPLE DISCORD SERVER!

# CAN EACH MEMBER CREATE OR TAKE A CHARACTER?

- YES! They can either have their own character, also called "OC", or they can also take an existing character (obviously, some characters from different franchises are already taken, but come DM me to show me the character if it is taken or not. If you don't want to, you can create your own "OC"!

# Does NewCentre support NSFW?

-  Yes! But in filtered rooms so as not to disturb people who are not interested in this kind of nonsense! Also, do not do this in other rooms that do not have this "ðŸ”ž" logo, otherwise you will be banned!
